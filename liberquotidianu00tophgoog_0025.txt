A circumstance happened during this summer 'as entraordlnaty as
it was upexpedled. The Scots, finding themselvee' unable to reli'st' the
force which ‘Edward was ριιριιιιιι3 to bring against thern, and having no
alhstance tn expe& from Frnuce, determined ιο put themselves under
the ριοιοιξιίοο οι the Roman Pontiff, 'and sent melleng ‹rers to Rome to maire
their offero of ιιιιιιιιιιΐιοιι. This application was readily listen‘ed to by l‘ope
Boniface3 wh9‚ thereupon, dispatched an ambalsador (the Βιιιιορ ol Vi· ³
cenza) rnto Englanrh who, being joined by the Archbilhop of Canterbu'ry,
proceededsso the Krng 11, and pretented to him a bnll from his llbliness,
uberein' he denicrl Edwards claim of superiority over Scotland'3 affirming,
thatsscotlanddid belong, and always had belonged, to the See 'of' Rome3
and enjoined Edward, 'if he perfisted in any claim to that kingdom, to
send his prodors or commiffioners to Rome, to make ont lbch right within
¹ sne months. Edward soon after called a parliament to meethim at Lin-
coin, aud, in the mean time, his ministers were employed m collecllng
